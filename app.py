        ðŸ¤– **Hello, Human!** ðŸ‘‹  

        Welcome to the future of research assistance, where humans and AI collaborate like never before. Our AI-powered tool is here to summarize papers, generate literature reviews, and make your life easierâ€”no caffeine required! â˜•ðŸš«  

        Remember, while I might know a lot about research, I promise not to "steal" your ideas... unless it's a really good one. ðŸ¤«  

        ### **How does this work?**  
        1. Upload your research paper in PDF format.  
        2. Enter the title and author (yes, even AI knows how to cite!).  
        3. Hit the "Summarize" button and let the magic happen!  

        Get ready for some *seriously* helpful AI, with a side of humor. ðŸ˜„
